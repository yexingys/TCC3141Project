# TCC3141 Assignment: Enhancement of BMI application
Body mass index (BMI) is a calculation of weight and height, calculated as weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of height in meters (m) [1]. Besides that, the BMI score will give an indirect measure of body fat to determine that the user may be underweight, healthy weight, overweight or obese. In addition, from a recent article [2] can be figured out that BMI had become a popular choice for users to monitor health conditions. Hence, it could be a simple tool for users to calculate and it is an inexpensive tool for healthcare.

On the other hand, users shall not fully depend on BMI to monitor their health condition, even though is it an alternative to keep track of users’ health conditions. Users could also need to realise that different lifestyle habits and genetic diseases can cause different health problems. Moreover, some articles and studies [3][4][5] points out that particular users that are low BMI might experience bad health, which could be due to having cloth of fats in a certain organ of the body that will bring harm to health. So, the user who has a higher BMI does not mean that is overweight but has a healthy level of fats.

Project Support Period: 2 September 2021 to 2 December 2021.

## Project Objective
1. To offer a simple mobile application on the cloud that allows users to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) by height (in meter) and weight (in kilogram).
2. To enhance the user experience and features from provided application source files.

## Features
Our application keeps track of the user's daily height and weight by calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI). It allows users to take care and improve their physical condition. The application will also provide some recommendations based on the user's condition to stay in a healthy state. With the recorded BMI, the application can provide previously recorded statistics and generate a BMI curve for the user to easily view the overall condition.
