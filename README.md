# TCC3141 Assignment: Enhancement of BMI application
Body mass index (BMI) is a calculation of weight and height, calculated as weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of height in meters (m) [1]. Besides that, the BMI score will give an indirect measure of body fat to determine that the user may be underweight, healthy weight, overweight or obese. In addition, from a recent article [2] can be figured out that BMI had become a popular choice for users to monitor health conditions. Hence, it could be a simple tool for users to calculate and it is an inexpensive tool for healthcare.

On the other hand, users shall not fully depend on BMI to monitor their health condition, even though is it an alternative to keep track of users’ health conditions. Users could also need to realise that different lifestyle habits and genetic diseases can cause different health problems. Moreover, some articles and studies [3][4][5] points out that particular users that are low BMI might experience bad health, which could be due to having cloth of fats in a certain organ of the body that will bring harm to health. So, the user who has a higher BMI does not mean that is overweight but has a healthy level of fats.

Project Support Period: 2 September 2021 to 2 December 2021.

## Project Objective
1. To offer a simple mobile application on the cloud that allows users to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) by height (in meter) and weight (in kilogram).
2. To enhance the user experience and features from provided application source files.

## Features
Our application keeps track of the user's daily height and weight by calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI). It allows users to take care and improve their physical condition. The application will also provide some recommendations based on the user's condition to stay in a healthy state. With the recorded BMI, the application can provide previously recorded statistics and generate a BMI curve and BMI distribution for the user to easily view the overall condition.

## How to Install
1. Install our APK files on your Android smartphone or tablet directly from your browser.
2. Just open your browser, find the APK file you want to download and tap it. You should be able to see it downloading on the top bar of your device.
3. Once downloaded, open Downloads, tap on the APK file, and tap Yes when prompted.
4. The app will begin installing on your device. 

## How to Use
1. Enter username and password to register.
2. Login with the username and password that registered.
3. Press the "Start" button to proceed BMI Calculator.
4. Enter the height and weight, and press the "Calculate" button.
5. It will show the BMI result and recommendation.
6. Users can press the "Show" button to compare previous results or the top left icon for back to the menu.
7. Users can continue to look out the statistics with BMI curve and BMI distribution at the "Chart".
8. Don't forget to log out after the record!

## Extension
### ChartMaker
An open source extension for MIT App Inventor to add pie, bar, and line chart through [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/).You can use this extension by simply downloading this [extension file](https://github.com/MillsCS215AppInventorProj/chartmaker/raw/master/edu.mills.appinventor.ChartMaker.aix) and import into your project.

#### Example
We have used ChartMaker and created line chart based on each user's BMI changes over the time and a pie chart that shows the BMI distribution in our system to encourage users to reach and maintain normal BMI.

## Version Control
For our project management, version control is an excellent way to review the different versions of a file or recall back a specific version. Most importantly, it allows multiple persons to work on the same project at the same time. Here, we use GitHub's own features for version control with the online Git repository. Don't get confused between Git and GitHub! These are two different things. Git is a free open source distributed version control system, while GitHub is an Internet hosting platform for software development.

Back to Git, why did it choose distributed version control systems (DVCS) but no others? It's because DVCS can get each user of their own repository and working copy. Here's a simple overview to understand how DVCS works:
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68465992/140318056-11189aa9-24de-485e-babd-962e31cdddc7.png" width=512 height=384></p>
Each user has a local repository of their own, which replicates the main repository on their hard drive. They can also commit and update their local repository without any conflicts with others. And, if they want to update to the latest changes, they can pull the updated main repository into their local repository and push it into their local copy.
