### Ong Yee Sheng
In the development of the recommendation function by MIT App Inventor, recursion techniques were applied to pursue more precise results based on the BMI of the users. The implementation processes are simpler and more convenient than code-based development. With the features provided by MIT App Inventor, the blocks-based and visual programming environment facilitate the creation of MyBMIUSR in significantly less time than traditional programming environments. In addition, the project is decided by the main project contributors to store and manage by GitHub. As a code hosting cloud service, it assists developers to track, record, and control either the project source code or documentation. By the application of GitHub, it could improve the efficiency of project development with features of git such as version control, it also could reduce the costs of performing the version rolling back while errors occur or are required. Last, the project members were motivated during the development progress to ensure the project was completed in a limited time, thus please receive countless thanks for the collaboration. Thank you.

### Lam Yin Yew
Throughout the development of this project, I have learned how to work as a team and develop an application in the cloud using MIT App Inventor. I have also noticed the benefit of using GitHub for version control in a team project. It makes it easier for us to communicate as we can leave comments each time a new version of the application is uploaded to inform our teammates of the new functionality added or any bugs found. Lastly, I also learned how to read data from the cloud storage and use chart to display the information in an easy-to-understand while trying to implement Chart Maker in this project effectively. In the end, I would like to thank my teammates for their collaboration and help when I was facing trouble in this project which eventually led us to achieving our goal for this project.

### Cheong Yi Fui
I learnt a lot from this project. I was surprised to learn that a mobile app can be developed through MIT App Inventor. Although, the MIT App Inventor development method is like playing a puzzle. But it is not easy at all and there is not much teaching available online. I also learnt how to use firebase. In short, firebase is very convenient, but the structure of the database is different from what we have learnt, so I still need to learn how to access and store data. I also learned about the use of github, which allows us to see what the latest updates are by looking at the comments, so that we can be more aware of what is being done and how it is progressing during development. In the end, the project was completed after a lot of hard work. I would like to thank all the team members for being so helpful when I didn't understand something or couldn't understand it. I hope we can get a good score together.

### Choong Shin-Yi
Throughout the development of this project, I have learned how to work as a team and separate work tasks to meet the requirement in a shorter time. By doing the user interface of the BMI application, I have learned the importance of a good user interface in an application. It not only helps the user to have more interest in the application but it also allows to navigate user in a consistent way, by having the buttons placed in the same place (for example the back button). Lastly, I would like to thank my teammate for being patience with me by guiding me throughout this project.

### Teh Kah Chung
It was my first time using MIT App Inventors, and it brought a great experience. The function implementation was easier than I expected, as I've wanted to try out, design an app in Andriod for a long time. The built-in blocks are also interesting and different from code development. It is easy to use and is a good introduction for those interested in programming. When drafting the user manual, I find there is a different experience there, and you work harder to think through the logical steps. Is this section simpler for the user to understand? Or, is the interface design neat and clean without problems? Coming to the testing and checking, I am grateful that my team members did a great job of resolving minor issues in a short time to ensure that our application finished as we expected.
