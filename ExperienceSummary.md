### Ong Yee Sheng
In the development of the recommendation function by MIT App Inventor, recursion techniques had been applied to pursue more precise results based on the BMI of the users and the implementation processes are simpler and more convenient than code-based development. With the features provided by MIT App Inventor, the blocks-based and visual programming environment facilitate the creation of MyBMIUSR in significantly less time than traditional programming environments. In addition, the project is decided to store and manage by GitHub. As a code hosting cloud service, it assists developers to track, record, and control either the project source code or documentation. By the application of GitHub, it could improve the efficiency of project development with features of git such as version control, it also could reduce the costs of performing the version rolling back while errors occur or are required. Moreover,

### Lam Yin Yew
Throughout the development of this project, I have learned how to work as a team and develop an application in the cloud using MIT App Inventor. I have also noticed the benefit of using GitHub for version control in a team project. It makes it easier for us to communicate as we can leave comments each time a new version of the application is uploaded to inform our teammates of the new functionality added or any bugs found. Lastly, I also learned how to read data from the cloud storage and use chart to display the information in an easy-to-understand while trying to implement Chart Maker in this project effectively. In the end, I would like to thank my teammates for their collaboration and help when I was facing trouble in this project which eventually led us to achieving our goal for this project.

### Choong Shin-Yi
Throughout the development of this project, I have learned how to work as a team and separate work tasks to meet the requirement in a shorter time. By doing the user interface of the BMI application, I have learned the importance of a good user interface in an application. It not only helps the user to have more interest in the application but it also allows to navigate user in a consistent way, by having the buttons placed in the same place (for example the back button). Lastly, I would like to thank my teammate for being patience with me by guiding me throughout this project.
