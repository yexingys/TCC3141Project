### Ong Yee Sheng
In the development of the recommendation function by MIT App Inventor, recursion techniques had been applied to pursue more precise results based on the BMI of the users and the implementation processes are simpler and more convenient than code-based development. With the features provided by MIT App Inventor, the blocks-based and visual programming environment facilitate the creation of MyBMIUSR in significantly less time than traditional programming environments. In addition, the project is decided to store and manage by GitHub. As a code hosting cloud service, it assists developers to track, record, and control either the project source code or documentation. By the application of GitHub, it could improve the efficiency of project development with features of git such as version control, it also could reduce the costs of performing the version rolling back while errors occur or are required.
